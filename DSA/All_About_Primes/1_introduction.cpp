- Two is the only Even Prime

- Every Prime can be written as 6b + 1 or 6n - 1, except 2 and 3
  where n and b is a natural number

- Goldbach Conjecture : Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes

- Wilson's Theorem : (p - 1)! % p  = (p - 1) modulo p

- 2 and 3 are onlyconsecutive numbers that are prime

// prieme numbers : it is only divisible by 1 and itself. Generally factors are 2.
